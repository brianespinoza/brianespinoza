##### MP3PoolR 
In a past life, I was a DJ taking computer science and statistics classes. I knew the music I needed and where to (legally) obtain it. I also only knew R at the time so I built a listener to download new music for me and it changed my life. 

***Did I break TOS?*** Probably. 

***Would I recommend building a webscraper in R?*** Never again. 

***How much time did I save?*** All of it.
