#### Current Projects:
##### [COOK.IO](https://github.com/brianespinoza/cook.io) 
cook.io is a site app I've designed to organize recipes and cookbooks from various sources. It's main value feature will leverage OCR to quickly digitize entire cookbooks. Recipes will be searchable and sortable in intuitive ways allowing users to quickly sift through hundreds of their own recipes.

#### Past Projects:
##### [OPENAI-Completions](https://github.com/brianespinoza/OpenAI)
GPT Completions enables users to integrate and leverage different variants of OpenAI's GPT models. The current implementation empowers users to generate creative, context-relevant text based on given prompts utilizing engines such as DaVinci, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4.

##### [OCRASSISTANT](https://github.com/brianespinoza/ocrassistant)
OCR Assistant provides an interface that allows users to integrate different OCR readers. Current implementation allows users to extract the text from images using Google's Tesseract engine.

##### MP3PoolR 
In a past life, I was a DJ taking computer science and statistics classes. I knew the music I needed and where to (legally) obtain it. I also only knew R at the time so I built a listener to download new music for me and it changed my life. 

Did I break TOS? Probably. 

Would I recommend building a webscraper in R? Never again. 

Did I save a bunch of time? I saved all of the time.
