### Hi there 👋
---
I'm currently a software developer at Quandis building out our data services for mlitary products. I mostly work in the C#/.NET world though I try to keep my python skills sharp on the side.

Hobbies include climbing 🧗‍♂️, cooking 🧑🏼‍🍳, and coding 👨🏻‍💻

Current projects:
- [cook.io](cook.io) a tool to help digitize recipes and organize cookbooks.
- [databridge](databridge) Databridge is a data processing service aimed to manage the intake, processing, and reading of data.
