#### Past Projects:
##### MP3PoolR 
In a past life, I was a DJ taking computer science and statistics classes. I knew the music I needed and where to (legally) obtain it. I also only knew R at the time so I built a listener to download new music for me and it changed my life. 

**Did I break TOS?** Probably. 

**Would I recommend building a webscraper in R?** Never again. 

**Did I save an incredible amount of time? 💯%!**
